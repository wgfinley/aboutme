  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a Front End <strong>developer</strong> who loves clean and modern design as well was <a href="http:///www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. I operate my own company called <a href="http://www.wtg.io" target="_blank">WrenchTech Guy LLC</a> where I focus on web design and hosting for small businesses and non-profits.</p>
  <p>I've been <strong>in love</strong> with the internet since 1990 and created my very first website in 1997. My passion for the net is brought about by its ability to lower the barriers to entry for the small guy &mdash; the underdog.</p>
  <p>I'm excited to start on the next phase of my <strong>development</strong> as a <strong>developer</strong> by being a part of the Thinkful Front End Web Development program. I look forward to further strengthening my skills working alongside the great community.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I'm originally from far north Chicago suburbs. I few years ago I traded in the flatland to become a cheesehead in southeastern Wisconsin.</p>
  <p>I love the <strong>small town</strong> atmosphere, the lack of traffic and the great feeling of <strong>community</strong> here. I look forward to helping the businesses here better their presence on the web.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I have too many to count and not enough money for them all! I love gaming (<em>Destiny</em> at the moment) and music by way of singing and audio production. I've spent the past nine years as a "virtual" lounge singer online.</p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>To work as an independent or a very trusted captive developer. I love to work collaboratively but in a <strong>bold</strong> way.</p>
  <h2>What's your background?</h2>
  <p>I attended the <a href="http://www.usc.edu" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> in the early 90s. I've always been an admitted geek and love solving problems. After a period of time in the auto industry I had the opportunity to move into technology.</p>
  <p>I've been doing websites with WordPress for 15 years. I designed a mobile app for an insurance company that is about to be deployed. I've done front and back end work managing my sites and projects.</p>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I am a total jazz and Great American Songbook freak. Lately I've been listening to the latest album from pianist <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harold-mabern-mn0000670211" target="_blank">Harold Mabern</a>.</p>
